The information about the SWAN package is distributed over four different documents. This User Manual describes
the complete input and usage of the SWAN package. The Implementation Manual explains the installation procedure
of SWAN on a single- or multi-processor machine with shared or distributed memory. The Programming rules is meant
for programmers who want to develop SWAN. The Scientific/Technical documentation discusses the physical and
mathematical details and the discretizations that are used in the SWAN program. The mapping of these numerical
techniques in SWAN code is also discussed.

\chap{General definitions and remarks} \label{ch:defin}

\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this chapter is to give some general advice in choosing the basic input for SWAN
computations.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
SWAN is a third-generation wave model for obtaining realistic estimates of wave parameters in coastal areas, lakes and
estuaries from given wind, bottom and current conditions. However, SWAN can be used on any scale relevant for
wind-generated surface gravity waves. The model is based on the wave action balance equation with sources and sinks.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
An important question addressed is how to choose various grids in SWAN (resolution, orientation,
etc.) including nesting.
In general, we consider two types of grids: structured and unstructured. Structured grids may be recti-linear and
uniform or curvi-linear. They always consist of quadrilaterals in which the number of grid cells that meet each
other in an internal grid point is 4. In unstructured grids, this number can be arbitrarily (usually between 4 and 10).
For this reason, the level of flexibility with respect to the grid point distribution of unstructured grids
is far more optimal compared to structured grids.
Unstructured grids may contain triangles or a combination of triangles and quadrilaterals (so-called hybrid grids).
In the current version of SWAN, however, only triangular meshes can be employed.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
Often, the characteristic spatial scales of the wind waves propagating from deep to shallow waters are very
diverse and would required to allow local refinement of the mesh near the coast without incurring
overhead associated with grid adaptation at some distance offshore. Traditionally, this can be achieved by employing
a nesting approach.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
The idea of nesting is to first
compute the waves on a coarse grid for a larger region and then on a finer grid for a smaller
region. The computation on the fine grid uses boundary conditions that are generated by the
computation on the coarse grid. Nesting can be repeated on ever decreasing scales using the
same type of coordinates for the coarse computations and the nested computations (Cartesian or
spherical). Note that curvi-linear grids can be used for nested computations but the boundaries
should always be rectangular.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
The use of unstructured grids in SWAN offers a good alternative to nested models not only because of the
ease of optimal adaption of mesh resolution but also the modest effort needed to generate
grids about complicated geometries, e.g. islands and irregular shorelines. This type of flexible
meshes is particularly useful in coastal regions where the water depth varies greatly. As a result,
this variable spatial meshing gives the highest resolution where it is most needed. The use of unstructured
grids facilitates to resolve the model area with a relative high accuracy but with a much fewer grid
points than with regular grids.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
It must be pointed out that the application of SWAN on ocean scales is not recommended from an
efficiency point of view. The WAM model and the WAVEWATCH~III model, which have been designed
specifically for ocean applications, are probably one order of magnitude more efficient than
SWAN. SWAN can be run on large scales (much larger than coastal scales) but this option is
mainly intended for the \underline{transition} from ocean scales to coastal scales (transitions
where nonstationarity is an issue and spherical coordinates are convenient for nesting).
\\[2ex]
\noindent
A general suggestion is: \underline{start simple}. SWAN helps in this with default options.
Furthermore, suggestions are given that should help the user to choose among the many options
conditions and in which mode to run SWAN (first-, second- or third-generation mode, stationary
or nonstationary and 1D or 2D).

\section{Limitations}

The DIA approximation for the {\bf quadruplet wave-wave interactions} depends on the width of the directional
distribution of the wave spectrum. It seems to work reasonably in many cases but it is a poor
approximation for long-crested waves (narrow directional distribution). It also depends on the frequency
resolution. It seems to work reasonably in many cases but it is a poor approximation for frequency
resolutions with ratios very different from 10\% (see command {\tt CGRID}). This is a fundamental problem
that SWAN shares with other third-generation wave models such as WAM and WAVEWATCH~III.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
The LTA approximation for the {\bf triad wave-wave interactions} depends on the width of the directional
distribution of the wave spectrum. The present tuning in SWAN (the default settings, see command
{\tt TRIAD}) seems to work reasonably in many cases but it has been obtained from observations in a narrow
wave flume (long-crested waves).
\\[2ex]
\noindent
As an option SWAN computes {\bf wave-induced set-up}. In 1D cases the computations are
based on exact equations. In 2D cases, the computations are based on approximate equations.
This approximation in SWAN can \underline{only} be applied to open coast (unlimited supply of water from outside
the domain, e.g. nearshore coasts and estuaries) in contrast to closed basin, e.g. lakes, where this option
should not be used.
The effects of wave-induced currents are always ignored.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
SWAN does not calculate {\bf wave-induced currents}. If relevant, such currents should be provided as input
to SWAN, e.g. from a circulation model which can be driven by waves from SWAN in an iteration procedure.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
In areas where variations in wave height are large within a horizontal scale of a few wave lengths,
{\bf diffraction} should be used. However, the computation of diffraction
in arbitrary geophysical conditions is rather complicated and requires considerable computing effort. To
avoid this, a phase-decoupled approach is employed in SWAN so that same qualitative behaviour of spatial redistribution
and changes in wave direction is obtained.
This approach, however, does not properly handle diffraction in harbours
or in front of reflecting obstacles.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
SWAN can be used on {\bf any scale} relevant for wind generated surface gravity waves. However, SWAN is
specifically designed for coastal applications that should actually not require such flexibility in scale. The
reasons for providing SWAN with such flexibility are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item to allow SWAN to be used from laboratory conditions to shelf seas and
  \item to nest SWAN in the WAM model or the WAVEWATCH~III model which are formulated in terms of
        spherical coordinates.
\end{itemize}
Nevertheless, these facilities are not meant to support the use of SWAN on oceanic scales because
SWAN is less efficient on oceanic scales than WAVEWATCH~III and probably also less efficient than WAM.

\section{Internal scenarios, limiters, shortcomings and coding bugs}

Sometimes the user input to SWAN is such that SWAN produces unreliable and sometimes even
unrealistic results. This may be the case if the bathymetry or the wave field is not well resolved. Be aware
here that the grid on which the computations are performed interpolates from the grids on which the input
is provided; different resolutions for these grids (which are allowed) can therefore create unexpected
interpolation patterns on the computational grid. In such cases SWAN may invoke some {\bf internal
scenarios} or {\bf limiters} instead of terminating the computations. The reasons for this model policy is that
\begin{itemize}
  \item SWAN needs to be robust, and
  \item the problem may be only very local, or
  \item the problem needs to be fully computed before it can be diagnosed.
\end{itemize}

Examples are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The user can request that \underline{refraction} over one spatial grid step is limited to about
        90$^{{\rm 0}}$(see command {\tt NUMERIC}). This may be relevant when the depth varies considerably
        over one spatial grid step (e.g. at the edge of oceans or near oceanic islands with only
        one or two grid steps to go from oceanic depths to a shallow coast). This implies
        inaccurate refraction computations in such grid steps. This may be acceptable when
        refraction has only local effects that can be ignored but, depending on the topography,
        the inaccurately computed effects may radiate far into the computational area.
  \item SWAN cannot handle wave propagation on \underline{super-critical current flow}. If such flow is
        encountered during SWAN computations, the current is locally reduced to sub-critical flow.
  \item If the \underline{water depth} is less than some user-provided limit, the depth is set at that limit
        (default is 0.05 m, see command {\tt SET}).
  \item The \underline{user-imposed wave boundary conditions} may not be reproduced by SWAN,
        as SWAN replaces the {\it imposed} waves at the boundaries that
        propagate into the computational area with the {\it computed} waves that move out of the computational
        area at the boundaries.
  \item SWAN may have \underline{convergence} problems. There are three iteration processes in SWAN:
        \begin{enumerate}
           \item an iteration process for the spatial propagation of the waves,
           \item if ambient currents are present, an iteration process for spectral propagation
                 (current-induced refraction and frequency shift) and
           \item if wave-induced set-up is requested by the user, an iteration process for
                 solving the set-up equation.
        \end{enumerate}
        \begin{itemize}
           \item[ad 1] For spatial propagation the change of the wave field over one iteration is
                       limited to some realistic value (usually several iterations for stationary
                       conditions or one iteration or upgrade per time step for nonstationary
                       conditions; see command {\tt NUMERIC}). This is a common problem for all
                       third-generation wave models (such as WAM, WAVEWATCH~III and also SWAN). It
                       does not seem to affect the result seriously in many cases but sometimes
                       SWAN fails to converge properly.
                       \\[2ex]
                       \noindent
                       For curvi-linear grids, convergence problems may occur locally where in some
                       points in the grid, the directions separating the 4 sweeping quadrants coincide
                       with the given spectral directions.
           \item[ad 2] For spectral propagation (but only current-induced refraction and frequency
                       shift) SWAN may also not converge.
           \item[ad 3] For the wave-induced set-up SWAN may also not converge.
         \end{itemize}
         Information on the actual convergence of a particular SWAN run is provided in the
         {\tt PRINT} file (see SWAN Implementation Manual).
\end{itemize}
Some other problems which the SWAN user may encounter are due to more {\bf fundamental shortcomings}
of SWAN (which may or may not be typical for third-generation wave models) and unintentional {\bf coding
bugs}.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
Because of the issues described above, the results may look realistic, but they may (locally) not be
accurate. Any change in these scenarios, limiters or shortcomings, in particular newly discovered coding
bugs and their fixes, are published on the SWAN web site and implemented in new releases of SWAN.

\section{Relation to WAM, WAVEWATCH~III and others}
The basic scientific philosophy of SWAN is identical to that of WAM (Cycle 3 and 4). SWAN is a third-generation
wave model and it uses the same formulations for the source terms (although SWAN uses the adapted code for the
DIA technique). On the other hand, SWAN contains some additional formulations primarily for shallow water.
Moreover, the numerical techniques are very different. WAVEWATCH~III not only uses different numerical techniques
but also different formulations for the wind input and the whitecapping.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
This close similarity can be exploited in the sense that
\begin{itemize}
  \item scientific findings with one model can be shared with the others and
  \item SWAN can be readily nested in WAM and WAVEWATCH~III (the formulations of WAVEWATCH~III
        have not yet been implemented in SWAN).
\end{itemize}
When SWAN is nested in WAM or WAVEWATCH~III, it must be noted that the boundary conditions for
SWAN provided by WAM or WAVEWATCH~III may not be model consistent even if the same physics are
used. The potential reasons are manifold such as differences in numerical techniques employed and
implementation for the geographic area (spatial and spectral resolutions, coefficients, etc.). Generally,
the deep water boundary of the SWAN nest must be located in WAM or WAVEWATCH~III  where shallow
water effects do not dominate (to avoid too large discontinuities between the two models). Also, the
spatial and spectral resolutions should not differ more than a factor two or three. If a finer resolution is
required, a second or third nesting may be needed.

\section{Units and coordinate systems}
\label{sec:units}

SWAN expects all quantities that are given by the user to be expressed in S.I. units:
m, kg, s and composites of these with accepted compounds, such as Newton
(N) and Watt (W). Consequently, the wave height and water depth are in m,
wave period in s, etc. For \underline{wind and wave direction} both the
Cartesian and {\em a} nautical convention can be used (see below). Directions and spherical
coordinates are in degrees ($^{{\rm 0}}$) and not in radians.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
For the output of wave energy the user can choose between variance (m$^{{\rm 2}}$) or energy
({\bf spatial}) density (Joule/m$^{{\rm 2}}$, i.e. energy per unit sea surface) and the
equivalents in case of energy transport (m$^{{\rm 3}}$/s or W/m, i.e. energy transport per unit
length) and spectral energy density (m$^{{\rm 2}}$/Hz/Degr or Js/m$^{{\rm 2}}$/rad, i.e. energy
per unit frequency and direction per unit sea surface area). The wave$-$induced stress
components (obtained as spatial derivatives of wave-induced radiation stress) are always expressed
in N/m$^2$ even if the wave energy is in terms of variance. Note that the energy density is also in
Joule/m$^{{\rm 2}}$ in the case of spherical coordinates.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
SWAN operates either in a Cartesian coordinate system or in a spherical coordinate system, i.e.
in a flat plane or on a spherical Earth. In the Cartesian system, all geographic locations and
orientations in SWAN, e.g. for the bottom grid or for output points, are defined in one common
Cartesian coordinate system with origin (0,0) by definition. This \underline{geographic origin
may be chosen totally arbitrarily by the user}. In the spherical system, all geographic locations
and orientations in SWAN, e.g. for the bottom grid or for output points, are defined in geographic
longitude and latitude. Both coordinate systems are designated in this manual as the
\underline{problem coordinate system}.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
In the input and output of SWAN the \underline{direction of wind and waves} are defined according to either
\begin{itemize}
 \item the \underline{Cartesian convention}, i.e. the direction to where the vector points, measured
       counterclockwise from the positive $x-$axis of this system (in degrees) or
 \item a \underline{nautical convention} (there are more such conventions), i.e. the direction where
       the wind or the waves come \underline{from}, measured clockwise from geographic North.
\end{itemize}
All \underline{other directions}, such as orientation of grids, are according to the Cartesian convention!
\\[2ex]
\noindent
For regular grids, i.e. uniform and rectangular, Figure~\ref{fig:compdom} (in Section~\ref{sec:moddesc})
shows how the locations of the various grids are determined with respect to the problem coordinates.
All grid points of curvi-linear and unstructured grids are relative to the problem coordinate system.

\section{Choice of grids, time windows and boundary / initial / first guess conditions}
\label{sec:choigrd}

\subsection{Introduction}

Several types of grids and time window(s) need to be defined: (a) spectral grid, (b) spatial (geographic)
grids and time window(s) in case of nonstationary computations.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
The {\bf spectral} grid that need to be defined by the user is a \underline{computational} spectral grid on
which SWAN performs the computations.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
SWAN has the option to make computations that can be nested in (coarse) SWAN, WAM or WAVEWATCH
III. In such cases, the spectral grid need not be equal to the spectral grid in the coarse SWAN, WAM or
WAVEWATCH~III run.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
The {\bf spatial} grids that need to be defined by the user are (if required):
\begin{itemize}
 \item a \underline{computational} spatial grid on which SWAN performs the computations,
 \item one (or more) spatial \underline{input} grid(s) for the bottom, current field, water level,
       bottom friction and wind (each input grid may differ from the others) and
 \item one (or more) spatial \underline{output} grid(s) on which the user requires output of SWAN.
\end{itemize}
The wind and bottom friction do not require a grid if they are uniform over the area of interest.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
For one-dimensional situations, i.e. $\partial /\partial y \equiv 0$, SWAN can be run in 1D mode.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
If a uniform, rectangular computational spatial grid is chosen in SWAN, then all input and output
grids must be uniform and rectangular too, but they may all be different from each other.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
If a curvi-linear computational spatial grid is chosen in SWAN, then \underline{each} input grid
should be either uniform, rectangular or identical to the used curvi-linear grid or staggered with
respect to the curvi-linear computational grid.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
If an unstructured computational spatial grid is chosen in SWAN, then \underline{each} input grid
should be either uniform, rectangular or identical to the used unstructured grid.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
SWAN has the option to make computations that are nested in (coarse) SWAN, WAM or WAVEWATCH~III.
In such runs, SWAN interpolates the spatial boundary of the SWAN, WAM or WAVEWATCH~III grid to the
(user provided) grid of SWAN (that needs to (nearly) coincide along the grid lines of WAM or WAVEWATCH
III or the output nest grid boundaries of SWAN). Since, the computational grids of WAM and WAVEWATCH
III are in spherical coordinates, it is recommended to use spherical coordinates in a nested SWAN when
nesting in WAM or WAVEWATCH~III.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
SWAN using an \underline{unstructured mesh} may be nested in SWAN employing a \underline{regular grid} and
vice versa. However, SWAN using an unstructured grid cannot be nested in WAM or WAVEWATCH~III.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
Nesting from a 2D model to a 1D model is possible although is should not be done by using the
commands {\tt NGRID} and {\tt NEST}. Instead, define the boundary point of the 1D model as an output
point (using command {\tt POINTS}) and write the spectra for that point using the command {\tt SPECout}.
In the 1D model, this spectra is used as boundary condition using the {\tt BOUNDSPEC} command.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
Similarly, the wind fields may be available in different {\bf time} windows than the current and water
level fields and the computations may need to be carried out at other times than these input fields.
For these reasons SWAN operates with different time windows with different time steps (each may have
a different start and end time and time step):
\begin{itemize}
  \item one \underline{computational time window} in which SWAN performs the computations,
  \item one (or more) \underline{input time window(s)} in which the bottom, current field, water level,
        bottom friction and wind field (if present) are given by the user (each input window may differ
        form the others) and
  \item one (or more) \underline{output time window(s)} in which the user requires output of SWAN.
\end{itemize}
In case of nesting, SWAN searches the boundary conditions in the relevant output file of the previous
SWAN, WAM or WAVEWATCH~III runs to take the boundary conditions at the start time of the nested run.
It will not take the initial condition (i.e. over the entire computational grid) for the nested run
from the previous SWAN, WAM or WAVEWATCH~III run.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
During the computation SWAN obtains bottom, current, water level, wind and bottom friction information
by tri-linear {\bf interpolation} from the given input grid(s) and time window(s). The output is in turn
obtained in SWAN by bi-linear interpolation in space from the computational grid; there is no interpolation
in time, the output time is shifted to the nearest computational time level. Interpolation errors can be
reduced by taking the grids and windows as much as equal to one another as possible (preferably identical).
It is recommended to choose output times such that they coincide with computational time levels.

\subsection{Input grid(s) and time window(s)}
The bathymetry, current, water level, bottom friction and wind (if spatially variable) need to be provided to
SWAN on so-called input grids. It is best to make an input grid so large that it completely covers the
computational grid.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
In the region outside the input grid SWAN assumes that the bottom level, the water level and bottom
friction are identical to those at the nearest boundary of the input grid (lateral shift of that boundary).
In the regions not covered by this lateral shift (i.e. in the outside quadrants of the corners of the input
grid), a constant field equal to the value at the nearest corner point of the input grid is taken. For the
current and wind velocity, SWAN takes 0 m/s for points outside the input grid.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
In SWAN, the bathymetry, current, water level, wind and bottom friction may be time varying. In that case
they need to be provided to SWAN in so-called input time windows (they need not be identical with the
computational, output or other input windows). It is best to make an input window larger than the
computational time window. SWAN assumes zero values at times before the earliest begin time of the
input parameters (which may be the begin time of any input parameter such as wind). SWAN assumes
constant values (the last values) at times after the end time of each input parameter. The input windows
should start early enough so that the initial state of SWAN has propagated through the computational area
before reliable output of SWAN is expected.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
One should choose the spatial resolution for the input grids such that relevant spatial details in the
bathymetry, currents, bottom friction and wind are properly resolved. Special care is required in cases with
sharp and shallow ridges (sand bars, shoals) in the sea bottom and extremely steep bottom slopes. Very
inaccurate bathymetry can result in very inaccurate refraction computations the results of which can
propagate into areas where refraction as such is not significant (the results may appear to be unstable).
For instance, waves skirting an island that is poorly resolved may propagate beyond the island with
entirely wrong directions. In such a case it may even be better to deactivate the refraction computations
(if refraction is irrelevant for the problem at hand e.g. because the refracted waves will run into the coast
anyway and one is not interested in that part of the coast). In such cases the ridges are vitally important
to obtain good SWAN results (at sea the waves are 'clipped' by depth-induced breaking over the ridges
which \underline{must} therefore represented in SWAN computation). This requires not only that these ridges
should be well represented on the input grid but also after interpolation on the computational grid. This
can be achieved by choosing the grid lines of the input grid along the ridges (even if this may require some
slight "shifting" of the ridges) \underline{and} choosing the computational grid to be identical to the
input grid (otherwise the ridge may be "lost" in the interpolation from the bottom input grid to the
computational grid).
\\[2ex]
\noindent
Finally, one should use a time step that is small enough that time variations in the bathymetry, current,
water level, wind and bottom friction are well resolved.

\subsection{Computational grids and boundary / initial / first guess conditions}
\label{sec:boundc}

The {\bf computational spatial grid} must be defined by the user. The orientation (direction) can be chosen
arbitrarily.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
The boundaries of the computational spatial grid in SWAN are either land or water. In the case of land
there is no problem: the land does not generate waves and in SWAN it absorbs all incoming wave energy.
But in the case of a water boundary there may be a problem. Often no wave conditions are known along
such a boundary and SWAN then assumes that no waves enter the area and that waves can leave the
area freely. These assumptions obviously contain errors which propagate into the model. These
boundaries must therefore be chosen sufficiently far away from the area where reliable computations are
needed so that they do not affect the computational results there. This is best established by varying the
location of these boundaries and inspect the effect on the results. Sometimes the waves at these boundaries
\underline{can} be estimated with a certain degree of reliability. This is the case if (a) results of another
model run are available (nested computations) or, (b) observations are available. If model results are
available along the boundaries of the computational spatial grid, they are usually from a coarser
resolution than the computational spatial grid under consideration. This implies that this coarseness of
the boundary propagates into the computational grid. The problem is therefore essentially the same as
if no waves are assumed along the boundary except that now the error may be more acceptable (or the
boundaries are permitted to be closer to the area of interest). If observations are available, they can be
used as input at the boundaries. However, this usually covers only part of the boundaries so that the rest
of the boundaries suffer from the same error as above.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
A special case occurs near the coast. Here it is often possible to identify an up-wave boundary (with
proper wave information) and two lateral boundaries (with no or partial wave information). The affected
areas with errors are typically regions with the apex at the corners of the water boundary with wave
information, spreading towards shore at an angle of 30$^{{\rm o}}$ to 45$^{{\rm o}}$ for wind sea conditions
to either side of the imposed mean wave direction (less for swell conditions; the angle is essentially the
one-sided width of the directional distribution of wave energy). For propagation of short crested waves
(wind sea condtions) an example is given in Figure~\ref{fig:boundreg}. For this reason the lateral boundaries
should be sufficiently far away from the area of interest to avoid the propagation of this error into this area.
Such problems do not occur if the lateral boundaries contain proper wave information over their entire length
e.g. obtained from a previous SWAN computation or if the lateral boundaries are coast.

\end{figure}

\noindent
When \underline{output} is requested along a \underline{boundary of the computational grid}, it may occur
that this output differs from the boundary conditions that are imposed by the user. The reason is that
SWAN accepts only the user-imposed \underline{incoming} wave components and that it replaces the user-imposed
\underline{outgoing} wave components with computed outgoing components (propagating to the boundary from
the interior region). The user is informed by means of a warning in the output when the
computed significant wave height differs more than 10\%, say (10\% is default), from the user-imposed
significant wave height (command {\tt BOUND}...). The actual value of this difference can be set by the
user (see the {\tt SET} command). Note that this warning will not apply in the case of unstructured grids.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
If the computational grid extends outside the input grid, the reader is referred to Section~\ref{sec:choigrd}
to find the assumptions of SWAN on depth, current, water level, wind, bottom friction in the non-overlapping area.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
The spatial resolution of the computational grid should be sufficient to resolve relevant details of the wave
field. Usually a good choice is to take the resolution of the computational grid approximately equal to that
of the bottom or current grid. If necessary, an unstructured grid may be used.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
SWAN may not use the entire user-provided computational grid if the user defines exception values on
the depth grid (see command {\tt INPGRID BOTTOM}) or on the curvi-linear computational grid (see command
{\tt CGRID}).
It must be noted that for parallel runs using MPI the user must indicate an exception value when
reading the bottom levels (by means of command {\tt INPGRID BOTTOM EXCEPTION}), in order to obtain
good load balancing.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
A computational grid point is either
\begin{itemize}
  \item \underline{wet}, i.e. the grid point is included in the computations since it represents water; this may vary
         with time-dependent or wave-induced water levels or
  \item \underline{dry}, i.e. the grid point is excluded from the computations since it represents land which may vary
        with time-dependent or wave-induced water levels or
  \item \underline{exceptional}, i.e. the grid point is permanently excluded from the computations since it is so
        defined by the user.
\end{itemize}
If \underline{exceptional grid points} occur in the computational grid, then SWAN filters the entire computational grid
as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item each grid line between two adjacent wet computational grid points (a wet link) \underline{without} an
        adjacent, parallel wet link, is removed,
  \item each wet computational grid point that is linked to only one other wet computational grid point,
        is removed and
  \item each wet computational grid point that has no wet links is removed.
\end{itemize}
The effect of this filter is that if exception values are used for the depth grid or the curvi-linear
computational grid, one-dimensional water features are ignored in the SWAN computations (results at
these locations with a width of about one grid step may be unrealistic). If no exception values are used,
the above described filter will not be applied. As a consequence, one-dimensional features may appear
or disappear due to changing water levels (flooding may create them, drying may reduce two-dimensional
features to one-dimensional features).
\\[2ex]
\noindent
The {\bf computational time window} must be defined by the user in case of nonstationary runs. The
computational window in time must start at a time that is early enough that the initial state of SWAN has
propagated through the computational area before reliable output of SWAN is expected. Before this time
the output may not be reliable since usually the initial state is not known and only either no waves or some
very young sea state is assumed for the initial state. This is very often erroneous and this erroneous initial
state is propagated into the computational area.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
The computational time step must be given by the user in case of nonstationary runs. Since, SWAN is
based on implicit numerical schemes, it is not limited by the Courant stability criterion (which couples
time and space steps). In this sense, the time step in SWAN is not restricted. However, the accuracy of
the results of SWAN are obviously affected by the time step. Generally, the time step in SWAN should be
small enough to resolve the time variations of computed wave field itself. Usually, it is enough to consider
the time variations of the driving fields (wind, currents, water depth, wave boundary conditions). But be
careful: relatively(!) small time variations in depth (e.g. by tide) can result in relatively(!) large
variations in the wave field.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
As default, the first guess conditions of a \underline{stationary} run of SWAN are determined with the
2$^{{\rm nd}}$ generation mode of SWAN. The initial condition of a \underline{nonstationary} run of SWAN
is by default a JONSWAP spectrum with a $\cos ^{2} (\theta )$ directional distribution centred around the
local wind direction.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
A quasi-stationary approach can be employed with stationary SWAN computations in a time-varying sequence
of stationary conditions.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
The {\bf computational spectral grid} needs to be provided by the user. In frequency space, it is simply
defined by a minimum and a maximum frequency and the frequency resolution which is proportional to
the frequency itself (i.e. logarithmic, e.g., $\Delta\, f\,\, =\,\, 0.1\,\, f$). The frequency domain may
be specified as follows (see command {\tt CGRID}):
\begin{itemize}
  \item The lowest frequency, the highest frequency and the number of frequencies can be chosen.
  \item Only the lowest frequency and the number of frequencies can be chosen. The highest frequency
        will be computed by SWAN such that $\Delta\, f\,\, =\,\, 0.1\,\, f$. This resolution is required
        by the DIA method for the approximation of nonlinear 4-wave interactions (the so-called quadruplets).
  \item Only the highest frequency and the number of frequencies can be chosen. The lowest frequency
        will be computed by SWAN such that $\Delta\, f\,\, =\,\, 0.1\,\, f$. This resolution is required by
        the DIA method for the approximation of nonlinear 4-wave interactions.
  \item Only the lowest frequency and the highest frequency can be chosen. The number of frequencies
        will be computed by SWAN such that $\Delta\, f\,\, =\,\, 0.1\,\, f$. This resolution is required
        by the DIA method for the approximation of nonlinear 4-wave interactions.
\end{itemize}
The value of lowest frequency must be somewhat smaller than 0.7 times the value of the lowest peak
frequency expected. The value of highest frequency must be at least 2.5 to 3 times the highest peak
frequency expected. For the XNL approach, however, this should be 6 times the highest peak frequency.
Usually, it is chosen less than or equal to 1 Hz.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
SWAN has the option to make computations that can be nested in WAM or WAVEWATCH~III. In such runs
SWAN interpolates the spectral grid of WAM or WAVEWATCH~III to the (user provided) spectral grid of
SWAN. The WAM Cycle 4 source term in SWAN has been retuned for a highest prognostic frequency (that
is explicitly computed by SWAN) of 1 Hz. It is therefore recommended that for cases where wind
generation is important and WAM Cycle 4 formulations are chosen, the highest prognostic frequency is
about 1 Hz.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
In directional space, the directional range is the full 360$^{{\rm o}}$ unless the user specifies a
limited directional range. This may be convenient (less computer time and/or memory space), for example,
when waves travel towards a coast within a limited sector of 180$^{{\rm o}}$. The directional resolution
is determined by the number of discrete directions that is provided by the user. For wind seas with a
directional spreading of typically 30$^{{\rm o}}$ on either side of the mean wave direction, a resolution
of 10$^{{\rm o}}$ seems enough whereas for swell with a directional spreading of less than 10$^{{\rm o}}$,
a resolution of 2$^{{\rm o}}$ or less may be required. If the user is confident that no energy will occur
outside a certain directional sector (or is willing to ignore this amount of energy), then the computations
by SWAN can be limited to the directional sector that does contain energy. This may often be the case of
waves propagating to shore within a sector of 180$^{{\rm o}}$ around some mean wave direction.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
It is recommended to use the following discretization in SWAN for applications in coastal areas:
\begin{table}[htb]
\begin{tabular}{l l}
\hline
   direction resolution for wind sea & $\Delta \theta = 15^o - 10^o$ \\
   direction resolution for swell    & $\Delta \theta = 5^o - 2^o$ \\
   frequency range                   & $0.04 \leq f \leq 1.00$ Hz \\
   spatial resolution                & $\Delta x, \Delta y = 50 - 1000$ m\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\noindent
The numerical schemes in the SWAN model require a minimum number of discrete grid points in each
spatial directions of 2. The minimum number of directional bins is 3 per directional quadrant and
the minimum number of frequencies should be 4.

\subsection{Output grids}
SWAN can provide output on uniform, recti-linear spatial grids that are independent from the input grids
and from the computational grid. In the computation with a curvi-linear computational grid, curvi-linear
output grids are available in SWAN. This also holds for triangular meshes.
An output grid has to be specified by the user with an arbitrary
resolution, but it is of course wise to choose a resolution that is fine enough to show relevant spatial
details. It must be pointed out that the information on an output grid is obtained from the computational
grid by bi-linear interpolation (output always at computational time level). This implies that some
inaccuracies are introduced by this interpolation. It also implies that bottom or current information on an
output plot has been obtained by interpolating twice: once from the input grid to the computational grid
and once from the computational grid to the output grid. If the input-, computational- and output grids are
identical, then no interpolation errors occur.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
In the regions where the output grid does not cover the computational grid, SWAN assumes output values
equal to the corresponding exception value. For example, the default exception value for the significant
wave height is $-$9. The exception values of output quantities can be changed by means of the {\tt QUANTITY}
command.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
In nonstationary computations, output can be requested at regular intervals starting at a given time
always at computational times.

\section{Activation of physical processes}
SWAN contains a number of physical processes (see Scientific/Technical documentation) that add or withdraw wave energy to or
from the wave field. The processes included are: wind input, whitecapping, bottom friction, depth-induced
wave breaking,
dissipation due to vegetation,
obstacle transmission, nonlinear wave-wave interactions (quadruplets and triads) and
wave-induced set-up. SWAN can run in several modes, indicating the level of parameterization. SWAN can operate
in first-, second- and third-generation mode. The first- and second-generation modes are essentially those
of Holthuijsen and De Boer (1988); first-generation with a constant Phillips "constant" of 0.0081 and
second-generation with a variable Phillips "constant". An overview of the options is given in Table below.

\end{center}
\end{table}
\noindent
The processes are activated as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\it Wind input} is activated by commands {\tt GEN1}, {\tt GEN2} or {\tt GEN3}\footnote{active by default, can be deactivated with command {\tt OFF}.}.
  \item {\it Whitecapping} is activated by commands {\tt GEN1}, {\tt GEN2} or {\tt GEN3}\footnote{active by default, can be deactivated with command {\tt OFF}.}.
  \item {\it Quadruplets} is activated by command {\tt GEN3}\footnote{active by default, can be deactivated with command {\tt OFF}.}.
  \item {\it Triads} is activated by command {\tt TRIAD}.
  \item {\it Bottom friction} is activated by command {\tt FRICTION}.
  \item {\it Depth-induced breaking} is activated by command {\tt BREAKING}\footnote{active by default, can be deactivated with command {\tt OFF}.}.
  \item {\it Vegetation dissipation} is activated by command {\tt VEGETATION}.
  \item {\it Obstacle transmission} is activated by command {\tt OBSTACLE}.
  \item {\it Wave-induced set-up} is activated by command {\tt SETUP}.
\end{itemize}
For the preliminary SWAN runs, it is strongly advised to use the default values of the model coefficients. First, it
should be determined whether or not a certain physical process is relevant to the result. If this cannot be
decided by means of a simple hand computation, one can perform a SWAN computation without and with
the physical process included in the computations, in the latter case using the standard values chosen
in SWAN.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
After it has been established that a certain physical process is important, it may be worthwhile to modify
coefficients. In the case of wind input one may at first try to vary the wind velocity. Concerning the bottom
friction, the best coefficients to vary are the friction coefficient. Switching off the depth-induced breaking
term is usually unwise, since this may lead to unacceptably high wave heights near beaches (the
computed wave heights 'explode' due to shoaling effects).

\section{Time and date notation}
SWAN can run for dates (i.e. nonstationary mode)
\begin{itemize}
  \item between the years 0 and 9999, if ISO-notation is used in the input (recommended) or
  \item between the years 1931 and 2030 if two-digit code for years is used (formats 2-6 in every
        command that contains moments in time).
\end{itemize}
Be careful when nesting SWAN in WAM, since WAM does not use ISO-notation.

\chap{Input and output files} \label{ch:inout}

\section{General}

SWAN is one single computer program. The names of the files provided by the user should comply with
the rules of file identification of the computer system on which SWAN is run. In addition: \underline{SWAN does not
permit file names longer than 36 characters}. Moreover, \underline{the maximum length of the lines in the input files
for SWAN is 120 positions}.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
The user should provide SWAN with a number of files (input files) with the following information:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a file containing the instructions of the user to SWAN (the command file),
  \item file(s) containing: grid, bottom, current, friction, and wind (if relevant) and
  \item file(s) containing the wave field at the model boundaries (if relevant).
\end{itemize}

\section{Input / output facilities}
To assist in making the command file, an edit file is available to the user (see Appendix~\ref{app:swanedt}). In its original
form this file consists only of comments; all lines begin with exclamation mark. In the file, all commands
as given in this User Manual (Chapter~\ref{ch:comm}) are reproduced as mnemonics for making the final command
file. Hence, the user does not need to consult the User Manual every time to check the correct spelling
of keywords, order of data, etc. The user is advised to first copy the edit file (the copy file should have a
different name) and then start typing commands between the comment lines of the edit file.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
SWAN is fairly flexible with respect to output processing. Output is available for many different wave
parameters and wave related parameters (e.g., wave-induced stresses and bottom orbital motion).
However, the general rule is that output is produced by SWAN only at the user's request. The instructions
of the user to control output are separated into three categories:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Definitions of the geographic location(s) of the output. The output locations may be either on a
        geographic grid, or along user specified lines (e.g., a given depth contour line) or at
        individual output locations.
  \item Times for which the output is requested (only in nonstationary runs).
  \item Type of output quantities (wave parameters, currents or related quantities).
\end{itemize}

\section{Print file and error messages}
\label{sec:prtfile}
SWAN always creates a print file. Usually the name of this file is identical to the name of the command
file of the computations with the extension (.SWN) replaced with (.PRT). Otherwise, it depends on the
batch file that is used by the user. Consult the Implementation Manual for more information.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
The print file contains an echo of the command file and error messages. These messages are usually
self-explanatory (if not, users may address the SWAN forum-page on the SWAN homepage). The print
file also contains computational results if the user so requests (with command {\tt BLOCK} or {\tt TABLE}).

\section{Sequence of commands} \label{sec:seqcomm}
SWAN executes the above command blocks (a,...,j) in the above sequence except (f), (i) and (j). The
commands of the blocks (f) and (i) may appear anywhere before block (j), except that {\tt TEST POINTS} must
come after {\tt READINP BOTTOM}. The commands of block (j) may appear anywhere in the command file (all
commands after {\tt COMPUTE} are ignored by SWAN, except {\tt HOTFILE} and {\tt STOP}). A sequence of
commands of block (g) is permitted (all commands will be executed without overriding). Also a sequence of
commands of block (h) is permitted (all commands will be executed without overriding).
\\[2ex]

Within the blocks the following sequence is to be used:
\begin{tabbing}
xxxxxxxxxxxx\= \kill
{In block (a)} \>: no prescribed sequence in block\\
{In block (b)} \>: {\tt READGRID} after {\tt CGRID}\\

It must be noted that a repetition of a command may override an earlier occurrence of that command.

\noindent
Many commands provide the user with the opportunity to assign values to coefficients of SWAN (e.g. the
bottom friction coefficient). If the user does not use such option SWAN will use a default value.

Some commands cannot be used in 1D-mode (see individual command descriptions below).

                  \> It must be noted that if the quadruplet interactions are to be computed (see\+\\
                     command {\tt GEN3}), then the {\tt SECTOR} should be 30$^o$ wider on each side than the\\
                     directional sector occupied by the spectrum (everywhere in the computational grid).\\
                     If not, then these computations are inaccurate. If the directional distribution of the\\
                     spectrum is symmetric around the centre of the {\tt SECTOR}, then the computed\\
                     quadruplet wave-wave interactions are effectively zero in the 30$^o$ range on\\
                     either end of the {\tt SECTOR}. The problem can be avoided by not activating\\
                     the quadruplet wave-wave interactions (use command {\tt GEN1} or {\tt GEN2}) or, if\\
                     activated (with command {\tt GEN3}), by subsequently de-activating them with\\
                     command {\tt OFF QUAD}.\-\\

                     directional resolution. In the case of {\tt SECTOR}, $\Delta\theta$ = ({\tt [dir2]} - {\tt [dir1]})/{\tt [mdc]}.\\
                     The minimum number of directional bins is 3 per directional quadrant.\-\\
{\tt [flow]}      \> lowest discrete frequency that is used in the calculation (in Hz).\\
{\tt [fhigh]}     \> highest discrete frequency that is used in the calculation (in Hz).\\
{\tt [msc]}       \> \underline{one less} than the number of frequencies. This defines the grid resolution\+\\
                     in frequency-space between the lowest discrete frequency {\tt [flow]} and the highest\\
                     discrete frequency {\tt [fhigh]}. This resolution is not constant, since the frequencies\\
                     are distributed logarithmical: $f_{i+1} = \gamma f_i$ with $\gamma$ is a constant. The minimum\\
                     number of frequencies is 4.\\
                     The value of {\tt [msc]} depends on the frequency resolution $\Delta f$ that the user requires.\\
                     Since, the frequency distribution on the frequency axis is logarithmic, the\\
                     relationship is:\\
                     \\
                     $\Delta f = \left( -1 + \left[ {\frac{\mbox{\tt [fhigh]}}{\mbox{\tt [flow]}}} \right] ^{1/{\mbox{\tt [msc]}}} \right)f$\\
                     \\
                     Vice versa, if the user chooses the value of $\Delta f/f \,\,(=\gamma-1.)$, then the value of\\
                     {\tt [msc]} is given by:\\
                     \\
                     $\mbox{\tt [msc]} = \log (\mbox{\tt [fhigh]}/\mbox{\tt [flow]})/\log (1+\Delta f/f)$\\
                     \\
                     In this respect, it must be observed that the DIA approximation of the quadruplet\\
                     interactions (see command {\tt GEN3}) is based on a frequency resolution of $\Delta f/f = 0.1$\\
                     and hence, $\gamma = 1.1$. The actual resolution in the computations should therefore\\
                     not deviate too much from this. Alternatively, the user may only specifies one of\\
                     the following possibilities:\\

\underline{This command {\tt READGRID UNSTRUC} must follow a command {\tt CGRID UNSTRUC}}.
With this command (required if the computational grid is \underline{unstructured}; not allowed in case of a regular or
curvi-linear grid) the user controls the reading of the ($x,y$) co-ordinates of the vertices including boundary markers and
a connectivity table for triangles (or elements). This table contains three corner vertices around each triangle in counterclockwise order.
This information should be provided by a number of files generated by one of the following grid generators currently supported by SWAN:
\begin{itemize}
  \item ADCIRC (\hl{http://www.adcirc.org})
  \item Triangle (\hl{http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/quake/public/www/triangle.html})
  \item Easymesh (\hl{http://www-dinma.univ.trieste.it/nirftc/research/easymesh/easymesh.html})
\end{itemize}
After setting up the vertices and the connectivity tables for cells and faces (automatically done in SWAN), SWAN will print
some information concerning the used mesh, among others, number of vertices, cells and faces and minimum and maximum gridsizes.
Furthermore, SWAN will check at two levels for a possible occurence of badly shaped triangles. Firstly, the number of triangles that meet at each
vertex inside the mesh should not be smaller than 4 or larger than 10. Secondly, the angles inside each triangle should not be higher
than 143$^o$. If, at least, one of these two situations occur, SWAN will print an error message.

OPTIONS \underline{CURVILINEAR} AND \underline{UNSTRUCTURED} NOT FOR \underline{1D-MODE}.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
With this required command the user defines the geographic location, size and orientation of an input grid
and also the time characteristics of the variable if it is not stationary. If this is the case (the variable is not
stationary), the variable should be given in a sequence of fields, one for each time step {\tt [deltinp]}. The
actual reading of values of bottom levels, currents, etc. from file is controlled by the command {\tt READINP}.
\underline{This command {\tt INPGRID} must precede the following command {\tt READINP}}.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
There can be different grids for bottom level ({\tt BOTTOM}), flow current ({\tt CURRENT}), bottom friction coefficient
({\tt FRICTION}), wind velocity ({\tt WIND}) and vegetation density ({\tt NPLANTS}).
If the current velocity components are available on different grids,
then option {\tt VX}, {\tt VY} can define these different grids for the $x-$ and $y-$component of the current, respectively
(but the grids must have identical orientation). Different grids for {\tt VX} and {\tt VY} may be useful if the data are
generated by a circulation model using a staggered grid. The same holds for the wind velocity
components. \underline{If the command {\tt INPGRID} is given without any of the keywords {\tt BOTTOM}, {\tt WIND}, etc.}
\underline{it is assumed that all the input grids are the same}.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
In the case of a regular grid (option {\tt REGULAR} in the {\tt INPGRID} command) the current and wind vectors
are defined with the $x-$ and $y-$component of the current or wind vector with respect to the \underline{$x-$axis of the input
grid}. In case of a curvi-linear grid (option {\tt CURVILINEAR} in the {\tt INPGRID} command) the current and wind
vectors are defined with the $x-$ and $y-$component of the current or wind vector with respect to the \underline{$x-$axis of
the problem} \underline{coordinate system}. For wind velocity and friction coefficient it is also possible to use a
constant value over the computational field (see commands {\tt WIND} and {\tt FRICTION}). No grid definition for
wind and friction is then required.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
Note that in case of option {\tt BOTTOM} only stationary input field is allowed.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
Note that in 1D mode, both $x-$ and $y-$components of the current and/or wind must be specified. Also, {\tt VX} and {\tt WX}
must always be followed by {\tt VY} and {\tt WY}, respectively.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
If the computational grid is unstructured (generated by Triangle or Easymesh), the input grids can be either regular
or identical to the used computational grid.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
Do not use the command {\tt INP BOTTOM} when the unstructured grid of ADCIRC is employed!
The file {\tt fort.14} contains the bottom levels and will be read by SWAN through the command {\tt READ UNSTRUC ADCIRC}.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
If land points remain dry during the computation (no flooding!), then these points can be ignored.
In this way, turn-around time and internal memory can be saved. This can be done by indicating bottom level in these points as
exception value. See command {\tt INPGRID BOTTOM EXCEPTION}.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
For parallel runs using MPI, an exception value for bottom levels should be prescribed in order
to have a good load-balancing!

\noindent
With this required command the user controls the reading of values of the indicated variables from file.
\underline{This command {\tt READINP} must follow a command {\tt INPGRID}}. Note that for each stationary or nonstationary
field, one combination of {\tt INPGRID} and {\tt READINP} suffices if one has more than one {\tt COMPUTE} command in a run.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
If the variables are in one file, then the {\tt READINP} commands should be given in the same sequence as the sequence in
which the variables appear in the file.
\begin{tabbing}
xxxxxxxxxxxx\= \kill
{\tt BOTTOM}        \> with this option the user indicates that bottom levels (m) are to be read from\+\\
                       file (bottom level positive downward relative to an arbitrary horizontal datum\\
                       level). The sign of the input can be changed with option {\tt [fac]} = $-1$. (see below).\-\\
{\tt WLEV}          \> with this option the user indicates that water levels (m) are to be read from\+\\
                       file (water level positive upward relative to the same datum level as used in\\
                       option {\tt BOTTOM}). Sign of input can be changed with option {\tt [fac]} = $-1$. If the\\
                       water level is constant in space and time, the user can use the command {\tt SET}\\
                       to add this water level to the water depth.\-\\
{\tt CURRENT}       \> recti-linear (curvi-linear) input grid: with this option the user indicates that\+\\
                       the $x-$ and $y-$component ($\xi-$ and $\eta-$component) are to be read from one and\\
                       the same file (with one {\tt READINP} command). With this option SWAN reads first all\\
                       $x-$components ($\xi-$components), and then all $y-$components ($\eta-$components)\\
                       (see below). The firs component ($x-$ or $\xi-$component) is always eastward oriented\\
                       and the second one ($y-$ or $\eta-$component) is always northwise oriented. The\\
                       components  $\xi$ and $\eta$ are taken along the directions of the grid lines\\
                       of the curvi-linear grid! If the current velocity is relatively large, i.e.\\
                       the Froude number $U/ \sqrt{g d}$ is larger than 0.8, it will be reduced such that\\
                       the Froude number becomes equal to 0.8.\-\\
{\tt WIND}          \> recti-linear (curvi-linear) input grid: with this option the user indicates that\+\\
                       the $x-$ and $y-$component ($\xi-$ and $\eta-$component) are to be read from one and\\
                       the same file (with one {\tt READINP} command). With this option SWAN reads first\\
                       all $x-$components ($\xi-$components), and then all $y-$component ($\eta-$components)\\
                       (see below). The components $\xi$ and $\eta$  are taken along the directions of the grid\\
                       lines of the curvi-linear grid! If the wind is constant, see command {\tt WIND}.\-\\
{\tt FRICTION}      \> with this option the user indicates that friction coefficient is to be read from\+\\
                       file for Collins: {\tt [cfw]} and for Madsen: {\tt [kn]} (no space- or time-variable\\
                       coefficient for the Jonswap expression, see command {\tt FRICTION}). If the\\
                       coefficients are constant in space and time: see command {\tt FRICTION}.\-\\
{\tt NPLANTS}       \> with this option the user indicates that horizontally varying vegetation\+\\
                       density (per m$^2$) is to be read from file. If the density is constant then\\
                       see command {\tt VEGETATION} for specifcation.\-\\
{\tt [fac]}         \> SWAN multiplies all values that are read from file with {\tt [fac]}. For instance\+\\
                       if the bottom levels are given in unit decimeter, one should make {\tt [fac]}=0.1 to\\
                       obtain levels in m. To change sign of bottom level use a negative value of {\tt [fac]}.\\
                       Note that {\tt [fac]} = 0 is not allowed!\\
                       Default: {\tt [fac]}=1.\-\\
{\tt 'fname1'}      \> name of the file with the values of the variable.\\
{\tt SERIES}        \> with this option (only for {\tt MODE NONSTATIONARY}) the user indicates that the\+\\
                       \underline{names} of the files containing the nonstationary variable(s) are located in a\\
                       separate file with name {\tt 'fname2'} (see below).\-\\
{\tt 'fname2'}      \> name of file that contains the \underline{names} of the files where the variables\+\\
                       are given. These names are to be given in proper time sequence. SWAN reads\\
                       the next file when the previous file end has been encountered. In these files the\\
                       input should be given in the same format as in the above file {\tt 'fname1'} (that\\
                       implies that a file should start with the start of an input time step).\-\\
{\tt [idla]}        \> prescribes the order in which the values of bottom levels and other fields\+\\
                       should be given in the file.\\

If the file does not contain a sufficient number of data (i.e. less than the number of grid points of the input
grid), SWAN will write an error message to the {\tt PRINT} file, and if {\tt [itest]}$>$0 (see command {\tt TEST}) it will
reproduce the data in the {\tt PRINT} file, using the lay-out according to {\tt [idla]}=1. This echo of the data to print
file is also made if the READINP command is embedded between two {\tt TEST} commands in the command file as follows:
\begin{verbatim}

\noindent
This command {\tt BOUNDSPEC} defines parametric spectra at the boundary. It consists of two parts, the first
part defines the boundary side or segment where the spectra will be given, the second part defines the
spectral parameters of these spectra. Note that in fact only the \underline{incoming} wave components of these
spectra are used by SWAN. The fact that complete spectra are calculated at the model boundaries from
the spectral parameters should not be misinterpreted. Only the incoming components are effective in the
computation.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
There are two ways to define the part of the boundary at which the spectra are imposed. The first ({\tt SIDE})
is easiest if the boundary is one full side of the computational grid, although \underline{it should not be used for
curvi-linear grids}. The second ({\tt SEGMENT}) can be used if the boundary segment goes around the corner
of the grid, or if the segment is only part of one side of the grid.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
This {\tt BOUNDSPEC} command can be given a number of times, i.e. to define incident wave fields on
various sides or segments of the boundary. One {\tt BOUNDSPEC} command can be used for only one side
or one contiguous segment.

                        (due to the occurrence of exception values) then this interruption is ignored\\

                        {\tt .node} file and the Easymesh {\tt .n} file or the last part of file {\tt fort.14}). Boundary\\

With this optional command a nested SWAN run can be carried out with the boundary conditions obtained
from a coarse grid SWAN run (generated in that previous SWAN run with command {\tt NESTOUT} not to be
confused with option NEST in this command {\tt BOUNDNEST1}). For this nested SWAN run the user has to
give the {\tt CGRID} command to define the computational grid before this {\tt BOUNDNEST1} command. The
computational grid for SWAN in geographic space is the area bounded by the SWAN coarse run nest
(SWAN boundary points of the nest). This implies that the boundaries of the SWAN coarse run nest and
the boundaries of the SWAN nested computational area should be (nearly) identical (see below). The

With this optional command ({\bf not fully tested}) a nested SWAN run can be carried out with the boundary
conditions obtained from a coarse grid WAM run (WAM Cycle 4.5, source code as distributed by the
Max Planck Institute in Hamburg). For this nested SWAN run the user has to give the {\tt CGRID} command
to define the computational grid before this {\tt BOUNDNEST2} command. The computational grid for SWAN
in geographic space is the area bounded by the WAM coarse run nest (WAM boundary points of the nest).
This implies that the boundaries of the WAM nest and the boundaries of the SWAN computational area
should be (nearly) identical (see below). The spectral frequencies and directions of the coarse grid run
do not have to coincide with the frequencies and directions used in the nested SWAN run (as defined in
the {\tt CGRID} command); SWAN will interpolate to these frequencies and directions in the nested run (see
Section~\ref{sec:boundc}).
\\[2ex]
\noindent
Note that SWAN will accept output of a WAM output location only if the SWAN grid point on the nest
boundary lies within a rectangle between two consecutive WAM output locations with a width equal to 0.1
times the distance between these output locations on either side of the line between these WAM output
locations.

This BOUNDNEST command is not available for 1D computations.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
Only boundary conditions generated by WAM Cycle 4.5 can be read properly by SWAN.
\\[2ex]

A nested SWAN run may use either Cartesian or spherical coordinates. A curvi-linear grid may be used
in the nested grid but the boundaries of this nest should conform to the rectangular course grid nest
boundaries.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
WAM output files are unformatted (binary); this usually implies that WAM and SWAN have to run on the
same computer. For those cases where WAM and SWAN run on different types of machines (binary files
do not transfer properly), the option {\tt FREE} is available in this command. The distributed version of WAM
does not support the required free format nesting output; WAM users who modify WAM such that it can
make formatted output, must modify WAM such that the files made by WAM can be read in free format, i.e.
with at least a blank or comma between numbers.

In SWAN three different formulations are available, i.e., that of Hasselmann et al. (1973, JONSWAP),
Collins (1972), and Madsen et al. (1988). The JONSWAP formulation can be applied with a constant friction
coefficient or with a varying friction coefficient that depends on the frequency-dependent directional
spreading. In the latter formulation the friction coefficient is set to 0.038$m^2 s^{-3}$ for frequencies
with directional spreading lower than or equal to 10$^o$ and it is set to 0.067$m^2 s^{-3}$ for frequencies
with a directional spreading higher than or equal to 30$^o$. For intermediate values of the directional
spreading the friction coefficient varies linearly between these two values.

CANNOT BE USED IN \underline{1D-MODE}.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
With this optional command the user provides the characteristics of a (line of) sub-grid obstacle(s)
through which waves are transmitted or against which waves are reflected (possibly both at the same
time). The obstacle is sub-grid in the sense that it is narrow
compared to the spatial meshes; its length should be at least one mesh length.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
The location of the obstacle is defined by a sequence of corner points of a line. The obstacles interrupt
the propagation of the waves from one grid point to the next wherever this obstacle line is located between
two neighbouring grid points (of the computational grid; the \underline{resolution of the obstacle} is therefore equal
to the computational grid spacing). This implies that an obstacle to be effective must be located such that
it crosses at least one grid line. This is always the case when an obstacle is larger than one mesh
length.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If a straight line is defined with more than two points, then the sum of the reflection of the parts
      may differ from the situation when you define it with just two points. This is due to the way
      obstacles are handled numerically in SWAN. It defines from computational grid point to its
      neighbor whether there is a crossing with an obstacle. In defining which directions of the wave
      spectrum should be reflected, i.e which directions are pointed towards the obstacle,  it uses the
      obstacle coordinates as defined by the user to define the angle of inclusion. This angle will be
      smaller if more points are defined, and so the reflected energy will be less for the computational
      grid point. This problem becomes smaller if the computational grid points are closer to the
      obstacle.\\
      \\
      {\bf So the advise is to define obstacles with the least amount of points possible.}
\item In case of sharp angles in the obstacles, it is very likely that there are more than one crossing
      between two computational grid points. In this case SWAN does not give correct reflection
      results.
      \begin{itemize}
         \item Avoid sharp angles in the obstacle definition.
         \item If necessary, put corner point of the sharp edge exactly on a line between two computational grid points,
               but not exactly on the grid point.
      \end{itemize}
\item At the boundaries of the computational area, the reflected spectrum is not taken into account.
      This can only be resolved by a different treatment of the boundaries in the program. Until this
      time, it is recommended to place obstacles at the inner area of the computational grid, not at or
      through the boundaries.
\item Obstacle lines are only effective when the obstacle line is bordered by wet points on both sides.
      In practice, this may give problems when a reflection line is also used to specify a boundary between
      wet and land points. This can be avoided by shifting the position of the reflection line or by
      creating wet points on the land side of the obstacle line.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
The computation of transmission and reflection is problematic if an obstacle runs exactly through one or
more grid points of the computational \underline{structured} grid; SWAN will move the obstacle over a small
distance (0.01 of the mesh size) if this occurs. Note that this will not be done in case of unstructured
grids.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
The reflection results are incorrect if more than one obstacle crosses the
same grid line between two neighbouring grid points. SWAN is not able to detect this, so the user must
check if his model fulfills this condition.

If this optional command is given, the wave-induced set-up is computed and accounted for in the wave
computations (during the computation it is added to the depth that is obtained from the {\tt READ BOTTOM}
and {\tt READ WLEVEL} commands).
This approximation in SWAN can \underline{only} be applied to open coast (unlimited supply of water from outside
the domain, e.g. nearshore coasts) in contrast to closed basin, e.g. lakes and estuaries, where this option
should not be used.
Note that set-up is not computed correctly with spherical coordinates.

\noindent
If this optional command is given, the diffraction is included in the wave computation.
But the diffraction approximation in SWAN does not properly handle diffraction in harbours
or in front of reflecting obstacles (see Scientific/Technical documentation). Behind breakwaters with a
down-wave beach, the SWAN results seem reasonable. The \underline{spatial resolution} near (the tip of)
the diffraction obstacle should be 1/5 to 1/10 of the dominant wave length.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
Without extra measures, the diffraction computations with SWAN often converge poorly or not at all. Two
measures can be taken:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item (RECOMMENDED) The user can request under-relaxation. See command {\tt NUMERIC} parameter {\tt [alpha]}
        and Scientific/Technical documentation (Eq. (3.31)). Very limited experience suggests {\tt [alpha]} = 0.01.
  \item Alternatively, the user can request smoothing of the wave field for the computation of the diffraction
        parameter (the wave field remains intact for all other computations and output). This is done with a
        repeated convolution filtering. The mother filter is
        \begin{displaymath}
           E^n_{i,j} = E^{n-1}_{i,j} - a \left[ E_{i-1,j} + E_{i,j-1} -4E_{i,j} + E_{i+1,j} + E_{i,j+1} \right]^{n-1}
        \end{displaymath}
        For $a = 0.2$ (recommended), the final width of the filter is $\varepsilon_x = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{3n} \Delta x$
        (in $x-$direction and similarly in $y-$direction) and $n$ is the number of repetitions (see Scientific/Technical
        documentation, Eq. (2.100)). Note that this smoothing option can not be applied in case of unstructured meshes.

                   the waves over the computational region.\-\\
\end{tabbing}
Notes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item All schemes (BSBT, SORDUP and S\&L) can be used in combination with curvi-linear grids. With the
        higher order schemes (S\&L and SORDUP) it is important to use a gradually varying grid, otherwise there
        may be a severe loss of accuracy. If sharp transitions in the grid cannot be avoided it is safer to use
        the BSBT scheme.
  \item In the computation with unstructured meshes, a lowest order upwind scheme will be employed. This
        scheme is very robust but rather diffusive. This may only be significant for the case when swell
        waves propagate over relative large distances (in the order of thousands of kilometers) within the
        model domain. However and most fortunately, in such a case, this will alleviate the garden-sprinkler effect.

\section{Output}
There are two categories of output commands:
\begin{enumerate}

\item \underline{Locations}\\
      commands defining sets of output \underline{locations} at which the user requires output. Each set is
      indicated with a name ({\tt {'sname'}} in this manual) which must be unique and not more than 8
      characters long.
      \\[2ex]
      Types of sets of output points:
      \begin{tabbing}
      xxxxxxxxxxxx\= \kill
      {\tt FRAME}   \> to define a set of output locations on a regular grid\\
      {\tt GROUP}   \> to define a set of output locations on a regular or curvi-linear grid\\
      {\tt CURVE}   \> to define a set of output locations along a curve\\
      {\tt RAY}     \> to define a set of output locations along a depth or bottom contour line\+\\
                       (with {\tt ISOLINE})\-\\
      {\tt ISOLINE} \> to define a set of output locations along a depth- or bottom contour line\+\\
                       (with {\tt RAY})\-\\
      {\tt POINTS}  \> to define a set of isolated output locations\\
      {\tt NGRID}   \> to define a set of output locations for a nested grid to be used in a\+\\
                       subsequent SWAN run\-\\
      \end{tabbing}

      Commands {\tt FRAME}, {\tt GROUP}, {\tt RAY}, {\tt ISOLINE} and {\tt NGRID} \underline{cannot} be used in 1D-MODE
      and command {\tt GROUP} \underline{cannot} be used in case of unstructured meshes. If one
      gives one name for two sets of output locations, the first set is lost (first in the sequence in the
      command file). Two special names: {\tt BOTTGRID} and {\tt COMPGRID} are reserved for use by SWAN
      (see below). The user may not define sets with these names.

\item \underline{Write / plot}\\
       commands defining data file output (\underline{write}) at the above defined set(s) of output locations:
      \begin{tabbing}
      xxxxxxxxxxxx\= \kill
      {\tt BLOCK}   \> write spatial distributions (only for FRAMEs and GROUPs)\\
      {\tt TABLE}   \> write output for (set of) output location(s)\\
      {\tt SPECOUT} \> write to data file the variance / energy (see command {\tt SET}) density\+\\
                       spectrum for (set of) output location(s)\-\\
      {\tt NESTOUT} \> write to data file two-dimensional action density spectra (relative frequency)\+\\
                       along the boundary of a nested grid (see command {\tt NGRID}) to be used in a\\
                       subsequent SWAN run.\-\\
      \end{tabbing}

      Commands {\tt BLOCK} and {\tt NESTOUT} \underline{cannot} be used in \underline{1D-MODE}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Output locations}

\noindent
CANNOT BE USED IN \underline{1D-MODE}.
\\[2ex]
With this optional command the user defines output on a \underline{rectangular,
uniform} grid in a \underline{regular} frame.
\\[2ex]
If the set of output locations is identical to a part of the computational grid, then the user can use the
alternative command {\tt GROUP}.

\begin{tabbing}
xxxxxxxxxxxx\= \kill

                   Default: {\tt [myfr]}=20\-\\
\end{tabbing}

\noindent
Some output may be required on a frame that is identical with the input (bottom/current) grid or with the computational grid (e.g. for
test purposes or to avoid interpolation errors in the output). These frames need not be defined by the user with this command {\tt FRAME};
the frames are always generated automatically by SWAN under the names {\tt {'sname'~=~'BOTTGRID'}} (for the bottom/current grid) and
{\tt {'sname'~=~'COMPGRID'}} (for the computational grid).

\idxcmd{GROUP}
\linecmd
\begin{verbatim}
GROUP 'sname' SUBGrid [ix1] [ix2] [iy1] [iy2]
\end{verbatim}
\linecmd

\noindent
CANNOT BE USED IN \underline{1D-MODE} AND IN CASE OF \underline{UNSTRUCTURED GRIDS}.
\\[2ex]
With this optional command the user defines a group of output locations on a \underline{rectangular} or \underline{curvi-linear}
grid that is \underline{identical} with (part of) the \underline{computational grid} (recti-linear or curvi-linear). Such a group may be
convenient for the user to obtain output that is not affected by interpolation errors (which would occur when an output grid is used
that is not identical with (part of) the computational grid).
\\[2ex]
Command {\tt CGRID} should precede this command {\tt GROUP}.
\\[2ex]
The subgrid contains those points (ix,iy) of the computational grid for which:\\
\noindent
{\tt [ix1]} $\leq$ ix $\leq$ {\tt [ix2]}   and   {\tt [iy1]} $\leq$ iy $\leq$ {\tt [iy2]}\\
\\
For convenience the size of the group, the corner coordinates and the angle with the problem coordinate
system are written to {\tt PRINT} file. The \underline{origin} of the computational grid is (ix=0,iy=0)!

\begin{tabbing}
 xxxxxxxxxxxx\= \kill
{\tt {'sname'}} \> name of the set of output locations defined by this command\\
{\tt [ix1]}     \> lowest grid index of subgrid in terms of computational grid in ix-direction\\

{\tt [iy2]}     \> highest grid index of subgrid in terms of computational grid in iy-direction\\
\end{tabbing}

\noindent
Limitations:\\
\noindent
{\tt [ix1]}$\geq$0, {\tt [ix2]}$\leq${\tt [mxc]}, {\tt [iy1]}$\geq$0, {\tt [iy2]}$\leq${\tt [myc]} ({\tt [mxc]} and {\tt [myc]} as
defined in the command {\tt CGRID}).

\idxcmd{CURVE}
\linecmd
\begin{verbatim}
CURve 'sname' [xp1] [yp1]  < [int] [xp] [yp] >
\end{verbatim}
\linecmd

\noindent
With this optional command the user defines output along a curved line. Actually this curve is a broken
line, defined by the user with its corner points. The values of the output quantities along the curve are
interpolated from the computational grid. This command may be used more than once to define more
curves.

\begin{tabbing}
 xxxxxxxxxxxx\= \kill
{\tt {'sname'}}   \> name of the curve\\
{\tt [xp1],[yp1]} \> \underline{problem coordinates} of the first point of the curve\+\\

                     if spherical coordinates are used in degrees (see command {\tt COORD})\-\\
{\tt [int]}       \> SWAN will generate output at {\tt [int]}$-$1 equidistant locations between two\+\\
                     subsequent corner points of the curve (including the two corner points of the curve)\-\\
{\tt [xp],[yp]}   \> problem coordinates of a corner point of the curve. Repeat the group\+\\
                     {\tt [int] [xp] [yp]} in proper order if there are more corner points are on the curve.\-\\
\end{tabbing}

\idxcmd{RAY}
\linecmd
\begin{verbatim}
RAY 'rname' [xp1] [yp1] [xq1] [yq1]  <  [int] [xp] [yp] [xq] [yq] >
\end{verbatim}
\linecmd

\noindent
CANNOT BE USED IN \underline{1D-MODE}.
\\[2ex]
With this optional command the user provides SWAN with information to determine output locations along
the depth contour line(s) defined \underline{subsequently} in command {\tt ISOLINE} (see below).
\\[2ex]
These locations are determined by SWAN as the intersections of the depth contour line(s) and the set of
straight rays defined in this command {\tt RAY}. These rays are characterized by a set of master rays defined
by their start and end positions ({\tt [xp],[yp]}) and ({\tt [xq],[yq]}). Between each pair of sequential master rays thus
defined SWAN generates {\tt [int]}$-$1 intermediate rays by linear interpolation of the start and end positions.
\\[2ex]
Note that the rays thus defined have nothing in common with wave rays (e.g. as obtained from conventional refraction computations).
\\[2ex]
Also note that when using rays, the input grid for bottom and water level should not be curvi-linear.

\begin{tabbing}

With this optional command the user defines a set of output locations along one depth or bottom level
contour line (in combination with command {\tt RAY}).

                   i.e. the depth with respect to datum level is used.\-\\
\end{tabbing}

\noindent
The set of output locations along the depth contour lines created with this command is of the type {\tt CURVE}.

With this optional command the user defines a set of individual output locations (points). The coordinates
of these points are given in the command itself or read from a file (option {\tt FILE}).

\\[2ex]
If the user wishes to carry out nested SWAN run(s), a separate coarse-grid SWAN run is required. With
this optional command {\tt NGRID}, the user defines in the \underline{present} coarse-grid run, a set of output locations
along the boundary of the \underline{subsequent} nested computational grid. The set of output locations thus defined
is of the type {\tt NGRID}.
\\[2ex]
Command {\tt NESTOUT} is required after this command {\tt NGRID} to generate some data for the (subsequent)
nested run (not with command {\tt BLOCK} because a set of locations of the type {\tt NGRID} does represent
an outline and not a geographic region).

\subsection{Write or plot computed quantities}

For definitions of output parameters, see Appendix~\ref{app:defvar}.
\\[2ex]
\underline{WARNING:}\\
When integral parameters are computed by the user from the output spectrum of SWAN, differences with
the SWAN-computed parameters may occur. The reasons are:
\begin{itemize}
   \item SWAN accepts at the boundaries of the computational grid only the user-imposed incoming
         wave components and it replaces the user-imposed outgoing wave components with computed
         components (propagating to the boundary from the interior region).
   \item during the computation of the parameters, SWAN adds an analytical (diagnostic) high-frequency
         tail to the discrete spectrum.
   \item SWAN has an option to only compute within a pre-set directional sector (pre-set by the user).
         Wave components outside this sector are totally ignored by SWAN (no additions or
         replacements).
\end{itemize}
This is particularly relevant along the boundaries of SWAN where the user-imposed integral parameters
(boundary conditions) may differ from the SWAN-computed parameters. The user is informed by means
of a warning in the output ({\tt PRINT} file) when the computed significant wave height differs
more than 10\%, say, from the user-imposed significant wave height (command {\tt BOUNDSPEC}). The actual
value of this difference can be set by the user (see the {\tt SET} command; Section~\ref{sec:startup}).

                   unit. The number of header lines is 8.\\

{\tt {'fname'}} \> name of the data file where the output is to be written to. Default for option\+\\
                   {\tt HEADER} is the {\tt PRINT} file. In case of {\tt NOHEADER} the filename is required. Note\\
                   that when the extension is `{\bf .mat}', a binary MATLAB file will be generated\\
                   automatically. This file requires less space on your computer and can be loaded\\
                   in MATLAB much faster than an ASCII file. Also note that the output\\
                   parameters are stored as single precision. (Hence, use the Matlab command\\
                   {\small \tt double} for conversion to double precision, if necessary.)\\
                   Binary MATLAB files are particularly useful for the computation with\\
                   unstructured grids. Some MATLAB scripts are provided with the SWAN\\

Note that the wave parameters in the output of SWAN are computed from the wave spectrum over the prognostic part of the spectrum
\underline{with the diagnostic tail added}. Their value may therefore deviate slightly from values computed by the user from the
output spectrum of SWAN which does not contain the diagnostic tail.

\noindent
This command orders SWAN to start the computation(s).
\\[2ex]
If the SWAN \underline{mode} is stationary (see command {\tt MODE}), then only the command {\tt COMPUTE} should be given here (no options!).\\
If the SWAN \underline{mode} is nonstationary (see command {\tt MODE}), then the computation can be
\begin{itemize}
  \item either stationary (at the specified time: option {\tt STATIONARY} here) or
  \item nonstationary (over the specified period of time: {\tt [tbegc]} etc.).
\end{itemize}

\noindent
To verify input to SWAN (e.g., all input fields such as water depth, wind fields, etc.), SWAN can be run
without computations (that is: zero iterations by using command {\tt NUM ACCUR MXITST = 0}).
\\[2ex]
In the case {\tt MODE NONSTATIONARY} several commands {\tt COMPUTE} can appear, where the wave state
at the end of one computation is used as initial state for the next one, unless a command {\tt INIT} appears
in between the two {\tt COMPUTE} commands. This enables the user to make a stationary computation to
obtain the initial state for a nonstationary computation and/or to change the computational time step
during a computation, to change a boundary condition etc. This also has the advantage of not using a hotfile
since, it can be very large in size.

\achap{Definitions of variables} \label{app:defvar}

In SWAN a number of variables are used in input and output. Most of them are related to waves. The definitions of these variables
are mostly conventional.
\begin{tabbing}
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\= \kill
HSIGN                \> Significant wave height, denoted as $H_s$ in meters, and defined as\+\\
                        \\
                        $H_s = 4 \sqrt{\int \int E(\omega, \theta) d\omega d\theta}$ \\
                        \\
                        where $E(\omega,\theta)$ is the variance density spectrum and $\omega$ is the absolute\\
                        radian frequency determined by the Doppler shifted dispersion relation.\\
                        However, for ease of computation, $H_s$ can be determined as follows:\\
                        \\
                        $H_s = 4 \sqrt{\int \int E(\sigma, \theta) d\sigma d\theta}$ \\
                        \-\\
HSWELL               \> Significant wave height associated with the low frequency part of\+\\
                        the spectrum, denoted as $H_{s,{\rm swell}}$ in meters, and defined as\\

                        $H_{s,{\rm swell}} = 4 \sqrt{\int_{0}^{\omega_{\rm swell}} \int_{0}^{2\pi} E(\omega, \theta) d\omega d\theta}$ \\
                        \\
                        with $\omega_{\rm swell}=2\pi f_{\rm swell}$ and $f_{\rm swell}=0.1$ Hz by default (this can be changed\\
                        with the command {\tt QUANTITY}). \-\\

                        \\
$T_{m01} = 2\pi \left(\frac{\int \int \omega E(\omega, \theta) d\omega d\theta}{\int \int E(\omega, \theta) d\omega d\theta} \right)^{-1} = 2\pi \left(\frac{\int \int \omega E(\sigma, \theta) d\sigma d\theta}{\int \int E(\sigma, \theta) d\sigma d\theta} \right)^{-1}$ \\

$T_{m02} = 2\pi \left(\frac{\int \int \omega^2 E(\omega, \theta) d\omega d\theta}{\int \int E(\omega, \theta) d\omega d\theta} \right)^{-1/2} = 2\pi \left(\frac{\int \int \omega^2 E(\sigma, \theta) d\sigma d\theta}{\int \int E(\sigma, \theta) d\sigma d\theta} \right)^{-1/2}$ \\

                        \\
                        This direction is the direction normal to the wave crests.\-\\

                        in the absence of currents).\\
                        Note that this peak period is related to the absolute maximum bin of the\\

\achap{Command syntax} \label{app:syntax}

\section{Commands and command schemes}

The actual commands of the user to SWAN must be given in one file containing all commands. This file is called the
\underline{command file}. It must be presented to SWAN in ASCII. It is important to make a distinction between the
\underline{description} of the commands in this User Manual and the \underline{actual} commands in the command file.
The descriptions of the commands in this User Manual are called \underline{command schemes}. Each such command scheme
includes a diagram and a description explaining the structure of the command and the meaning of the keyword(s) and
of the data in the command.  The proper sequence of the commands is given in Section~\ref{sec:seqcomm}.

\section{Command}

\subsection{Keywords}

Each command instructs SWAN to carry out a certain action which SWAN executes before it reads the next command.
A command must always start with a keyword (which is also the name of the command) which indicates the primary
function of that command; see list in Section~\ref{sec:lstcomm}). A simple command may appear in its command
scheme as:
\begin{verbatim}
  KEYword data
\end{verbatim}
A command may contain more than one keyword (which refines the instructions to SWAN), e.g.,
\begin{verbatim}
  KEY1word KEY2word data
\end{verbatim}
where {\tt KEY2word} is the second keyword.

\subsubsection{Spelling of keywords}

In every command scheme, keywords appear as words in both lower- and upper-case letters. When typing the command or
keyword in the command file, the user {\bf must at least} copy literally the part with upper-case letters. SWAN reads
only this part and SWAN is case insensitive except for one instance (character strings), see below. When typing the
keyword in the command file, any extension of the part with upper-case letters is at the users discretion as long as
the extension is limited to letters or digits, as well as the characters $-$ and \_. So, in the first command outlined
above one may write: {\tt KEY} or {\tt KEYW} or {\tt KEY}$-${\tt word} or {\tt keyhole}, etc., whereas with the
abovementioned second command scheme, {\tt key1 KEY2 data} may appear in the command file.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
In the command file
\begin{itemize}
  \item a keyword is closed by a blank or one of the following characters = or :
  \item a keyword is not enclosed by square brackets or quotes,
  \item a keyword followed by a comma (,) is interpreted as a keyword followed by an empty data field (see below).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Required and optional keywords}

All keywords in a command are required except when an option is available.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
Optional keywords are indicated in the command scheme with the following signs enclosing the keywords concerned:
\begin{verbatim}
  |  KEY1word ...... data ....... |
 <                                 >
  |  KEY2word ...... data ....... |
\end{verbatim}
For the above example it may appear as:
\begin{verbatim}
            |  KEY2word data |
 KEY1word  <                  >
            |  KEY3word data |
\end{verbatim}
In case the user does not indicate an option in a command, SWAN chooses the alternative indicated with an arrow ({\tt ->})
appearing in the command scheme (the default option). In the above example, it may appear as:
\begin{verbatim}
            |    KEY2word data |
 KEY1word  <                    >
            | -> KEY3word data |
\end{verbatim}
where {\tt KEY3WORD} is the default option.

\subsubsection{Repetitions of keywords and/or other data}

The use of keywords is sometimes repetitive, e.g. in a sequence of data and keywords containing many locations in $x,y-$space.
In such a case, the command scheme indicates this repetitive nature by placing the keywords (and data) concerned between
angle brackets {\tt < >}. For instance,
\begin{verbatim}
 KEY1word <data KEY2word data>
\end{verbatim}
In the actual command in the command file the user must give such a sequence. It ends with either
\begin{itemize}
  \item end of line
  \item a keyword other than the ones mentioned in the repetition group
  \item the character / or ;
\end{itemize}
If more than one line is required for a command, the user may continue on the next line as described in Section~\ref{sec:endlin}.
The repetition may consist of one instance (in fact, no repetition at all).

\subsection{Data}

Most commands contain data, either character data or numerical data.

\subsubsection{Character data and numerical data}

Character data (character strings) are represented in the command schemes by names, enclosed in quotes ('    ').
\\[2ex]
\noindent
Numerical data are represented in the command schemes by names enclosed in square brackets ([    ]).
\\[2ex]
\noindent
As a rule, an error message will result if numerical data is given where character data should be given.

\subsubsection{Spelling of data}

Character data are represented as character strings (sequence of characters and blanks) between quotes (in the command scheme
and in the command file). SWAN interprets an end of line as an end quote (a character data field can therefore never extend over
more than one line).
\\[2ex]
\noindent
In a command scheme the character string is always a name (which is placed between quotes as indicated). In the command file such
a name can be entered in two ways:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Replace the name by another character string at the users discretion (between quotes; this is the only occurrence where
        SWAN is case sensitive; e.g. for text to appear in a plot.\\
        Example:\\
        command scheme: {\tt KEYword 'City' data}\\
        command file: {\tt KEY 'Amsterdam' data}
  \item Copy the name of the variable (without the quotes) literally followed by an = sign and a name at the users discretion
        (between quotes). SWAN interprets the copied name in the command file as a keyword with all the characteristics of a keyword
        such as ending a sequence of optional data (see below). As with other keywords the name of the variable is case-insensitive.\\
        Example:\\
        command scheme: {\tt KEYword 'City' data}\\
        command file: {\tt KEY city='Amsterdam' data}
\end{itemize}
As a rule, an error message will result if numerical data is given where character data should be given.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
Numerical data are simple numbers , e.g. 15 or $-$7 (integer data), or 13.7 or 0.8E$-$4 (real data). Whether or not integer number or
real number should be given by the user is indicated in the description of the command scheme.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
Note that a decimal point is not permitted in an integer number. On the other hand, an integer number is accepted by SWAN where a real
number should be given.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
In a command scheme, the number is always indicated with a name (which is placed  between square brackets). In the command file such a
name can be entered in two ways:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Replace the name by a number (not between square brackets).\\
        Example:\\
        command scheme: {\tt KEYword [nnn]}\\
        command file: {\tt KEY 314}
  \item Copy the name of the variable (without the quotes) literally followed by an = sign and the number (not between square brackets).
        SWAN interprets the copied name in the command file as a keyword with all the characteristics of a keyword
        such as ending a sequence of optional data (see below). As with other keywords the name of the variable is case-insensitive.\\
        Example:\\
        command scheme: {\tt KEYword [nnn]}\\
        command file: {\tt KEY nnn=314}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Required data and optional data}

All data must be given by the user in the command file in the same order as they appear in the command scheme. They are separated by blanks
or comma's.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
Required data (indicated in the description of each individual command) must be given explicitly as character string or numbers.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
Optional data are indicated
\begin{description}
  \item[(a)] in the text of each individual command or
  \item[(b)] for sets of data: in parenthesis around the data concerned\\
             \begin{verbatim}
               ( data )
             \end{verbatim}
             For example:\\
             \begin{verbatim}
                KEY1word KEY2word 'name' ([nnn] [mmm]) [zzz]
             \end{verbatim}
             or
  \item[(c)] some optional data are indicate in the same way as optional keywords are indicated:
             \begin{verbatim}
                | .....data.....|
               <                 >
                | .....data.....|
             \end{verbatim}
\end{description}
Optional data of the kind (a) or (b) may be omitted by giving blanks between comma's (SWAN then substitutes reasonable default values).
If after a required datum all data is optional (till the next keyword or the next end-of-line), then the comma's may be omitted too.
Optional data of the kind (c) are to be treated in the same way as optional keywords.

\section{Command file and comments}

All text after one \$ or between two \$ signs on one line in the command file is ignored by SWAN as
comment. Such comments may be important to the user e.g., to clarify the meaning of the commands
used. In fact, this option has been used to create the edit file {\tt swan.edt} (see
Appendix~\ref{app:swanedt}). Anything appearing after two \$ signs is not interpreted as comment, but
again as data to be processed (possibly interrupted again by \$ or two \$ signs). Since version 40.20,
the exclamation mark `!' can be used as comment sign. Everthing behind a ! is interpreted as comment,
also if ! or \$ are in that part of the input line.

\section{End of line or continuation} \label{sec:endlin}

A command in the command file may be continued on the next line if the previous line terminates with a
continuation mark \& or \_ (underscore).

\achap{File {\tt swan.edt}} \label{app:swanedt}

Below the file {\tt swan.edt} is presented in which all the commands that can be used with SWAN are specified.

\achap{Spectrum files, input and output} \label{app:spcform}

This appendix described the format of the files for spectral input (command {\tt BOUNdspec}) and output
(commands {\tt SPECout} and {\tt NESTout}) by SWAN. The files are recognized by SWAN or another reading program
by the presence of the keyword SWAN and a version number on the first line of the file. This description
is valid for version number 1.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
These files contain the following information:
\begin{itemize}
  \item coordinates of locations
  \item frequencies
  \item directions (if used for 2D)
  \item time (if time-dependent)
  \item spectral energy or variance densities (and average direction and direction spreading if 1D)
\end{itemize}

\underline{Formal description of the 1D- and 2D-spectral file}
\\[2ex]
\noindent
This description refers to either {\bf write or read} energy/variance density spectra {\bf to or from} the file.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
The description of the file to write or read source terms is identical to this description except that the
quantities obviously differ.
\\[2ex]
\noindent
The format that is used by SWAN or should be used by the user when offering the file to SWAN is free format (FORTRAN convention)
except that all keywords and names of quantities (see below) should start on the first position of the line on which they appear
(see Appendix~\ref{app:syntax} for the syntax of keywords). This format implies that all information on each line after the
required input for SWAN is ignored by SWAN. This can be used to enter user's information at the discretion of the user.
