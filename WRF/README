How to compile and run?
-----------------------

- In WRFV2 directory, type 'configure' - this will create a configure.wrf
  file that has appropriate compile options for the supported computers.

  Note: WRF requires netCDF library. If your netCDF library is installed in
        some odd directory, set environment variable NETCDF before you type
        'configure'. For example, 

        setenv NETCDF /usr/local/lib32/r4i4

- Type 'compile case_name' where you can find the case_names by simply typing
  compile. The following are available:

        compile em_b_wave
        compile em_hill2d_x
        compile em_grav2d_x
        compile em_quarter_ss
        compile em_real
        compile em_squall2d_x
        compile em_squall2d_y

- If sucessfully, this will create either real.exe or ideal.exe and wrf.exe
  in directory main/, and the appropriate executables will be linked into
  the test directoires under test/case_name, or run/.

- cd to the appropriate test or run direcotry to run ideal/real/wrf.

- If it is one of the idealized cases (b_wave, hill2d_x, grav2d_x, quarter_ss,
  squall2d_x or squall2d_y), cd the the appropriate directory, type

  ideal.exe 

  to produce wrfinput_d01 file for wrf model. Then type

  wrf.exe 

  to run. 

- If it is real-data case (real), place files from SI (wrf_real_input_em.*)
  in the appropriate directory, type

  real.exe

  to produce wrfbdy_d01 and wrfinput_d01. Then type

  wrf.exe

  to run.

- If you use mpich, type

  mpirun -np number-of-processors wrf.exe

======================================

What is in WRF V2?

- Advanced Research WRF (ARW) solver: Eulerian mass, hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic
  * Arakawa C-grid staggering
  * Runge-Kutta 2nd and 3rd order timestep options
  * scalar-conserving flux form for prognostic variables
  * 2nd to 6th order advection options (horizontal and vertical)
  * time-split small step for acoustic modes
  * small step horizontally explicit, vertically implicit
  * divergence damping option and vertical time off-centering
  * external-mode filtering option for mass model
  * hydrostatic option via namelist option
  * positive-definite advection for moisture, scalar, tke and chemical tracers (since 2.2)

- Two-way nesting:
  * multiple domains and multiple nest levels
  * supports integer nest grid ratio
  * feedback option for both odd and even nest grid ratios (since 2.0.3)
  * smoothing options

- One-way nesting (since 2.0.2)

- Moving nest (since 2.1)
  * Specified move.
  * Automatic move using a mid-level vortex-following algorithm.

- Physics options:
  * microphysics (Kessler/ WRF Single Moment 3, 5 and 6 class / Lin et al./
    Eta Ferrier / Thompson [a new version in 2.2])
  * cumulus parameterization (Kain-Fritsch with shallow convection / 
    Betts-Miller-Janjic / Grell-Devenyi ensemble)
  * planetary boundary layer (Yosei University (S. Korea) / Mellor-Yamada-Janjic)
  * surface layer (similarity theory MM5 / Eta)
  * slab soil model (5-layer thermal diffusion / Noah land-surface model (4-level) /
    RUC LSM (6-level) )
  * Urban canopy model (works with Noah LSM) (since 2.2)
  * longwave radiation (RRTM, CAM)
  * shortwave radiation (simple MM5 scheme / Goddard / CAM)
  * sub-grid turbulence (constant K diffusion/ 2-D Smagorinsky/ predicted TKE /
    2-D, 6th order diffusion)
  * land-use categories determine surface properties
  * three-dimensional analysis nudging (since 2.2)
  * observation nudging (since 2.2)

- Software

  * Hierarchical software architecture that insulates scientific code
    (Model Layer) from computer architecture (Driver Layer)
  * Multi-level parallelism supporting shared-memory (OpenMP), distributed-memory (MPI), 
    and hybrid share/distributed modes of execution
  * Active data registry: defines and manages model state fields, I/O,
    nesting, configuration, and numerous other aspects of WRF through a single file, 
    called the Registry
  * Two-way nesting:
      Easy to extend: forcing and feedback of new fields specified by
        editing a single table in the Registry
      Efficient: 5-8% overhead on 64 processes of IBM
      Moving nests.
  * Enhanced I/O options:
      NetCDF and Parallel HDF5 formats
      Five auxiliary history output streams separately controllable through the namelist
      Output file names and time-stamps specifiable through namelist
      Special output stream for 3DVAR
  * Efficient execution on a range of computing platforms:
      IBM SP systems, (e.g. NCAR "bluesky" Power4-based system)
      HP/Compaq Alpha/OSF workstation, SMP, and MPP systems (e.g. Pittsburgh 
         Supercomputing Center TCS)
      SGI Origin and Altix
      Linux/Intel
         IA64 MPP (HP Superdome, SGI Altix, NCSA Teragrid systems)
         IA64 SMP
         Pentium 3/4 SMP and SMP clusters (NOAA/FSL iJet system)
	 PGI and Intel compilers supported
      Alpha Linux (NOAA/FSL Jet system)
      Sun Solaris (single threaded and SMP)
      Cray X1, X1e (vector), X1D (Opteron)
      Mac G5, xlf compiler (no DM-parallel yet)
      HP-UX
      Other ports under development:
         NEC SX/6
         Fujitsu VPP 5000
  * RSL_LITE: optional new communication layer, scalable to very
    large domains, support nesting.
  * ESMF Time Management, including exact arithmetic for fractional
    time steps (no drift).
  * ESMF integration - WRF can be run as an ESMF component.
  * Improved documentation, both on-line (web based browsing tools) and in-line
