This file explains how to compile the NCEP BUFRLIB software, which is
described in detail at http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/sib/decoders/BUFRLIB/,
and whose usage is governed by the terms and conditions of the disclaimer

The NCEP BUFRLIB software has been compiled and tested across a wide variety
of UNIX platforms, including AIX 4.x and 5.x, HP-UX 9.x and 10.x, IRIX 6.x,
SunOS 5.x and RedHat Linux 5.2; thus, it should port with minimal difficulty
to any UNIX system by following the steps below:

1)  Define two environment variables on the local machine:

	$FC to point to the local FORTRAN 77 compiler

	$AC to point to the local ANSI C compiler

2)  Run the script "preproc.sh" to pre-process all of the "*.F" files on the
    local machine.  Once this is done, each such file should now have a "*.f"
    counterpart.

3)  At this point, the source code can normally be compiled using:

	$FC -c *.f

	$AC -c *.c

    However, note that the option "-DUNDERSCORE" should be added to the second
    of these two commands if the local FORTRAN 77 compiler appends an underscore
    character to subprogram names in its object namespace.  In such cases,
    specifying "-DUNDERSCORE" to the ANSI C compiler will append a matching
    underscore character to any ANSI C references to the same subprogram names,
    thereby allowing the linker to correctly resolve such references across the
    C <-> FORTRAN interface at link time.

4)  Once compilation has been successfully completed, it is then recommended to
    assemble all of the compiled object files into a single archive library via:

        ar crv $BUFRLIB *.o

    where $BUFRLIB points to the desired pathname for the BUFRLIB archive
    library on the local machine.  This archive library can then be easily
    linked whenever the user's application program is subsequently compiled on
    the same local system.
